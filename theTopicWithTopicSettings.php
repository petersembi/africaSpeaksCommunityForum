                                        <h5>Statement of Faith</h5>

<ol>
	<li>The Holy Scriptures, in it's original form, is the inerrant Word of God.</li>
	<li>There is only one God who reveals Himself as Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.</li>
	<li>We are separated from God due to sin.</li>
	<li>God's Son, Jesus Christ, was born of the virgin Mary, died on the cross for our sins, and rose again on the third day.</li>
	<li>We can only be saved by repenting of sin, and accepting Jesus Christ as our Lord and Savior by faith as stated in John 3:16. (The faith mentioned here will produce actions)</li>
	<li>This salvation is provided by the grace of God. We cannot be saved through our own efforts, our works or by the intervention of man on our behalf.</li>
</ol>

<h5>Mission</h5>

<p>The Africa Speaks Community Forum exists for the following reasons:</p>

<ol>
	<li>To provide a friendly place for believers to discuss Biblical, theological and social issues in a rational manner.</li>
	<li>To promote and support mutual spiritual growth and biblical learning among forum Users.</li>
	<li>To provide a place of fellowship and prayer for believers.</li>
	<li>But, most importantly to Glorify our Savior, Jesus Christ.</li>
</ol>

<h5>Forum Rules</h5>

<h6>Content of posts</h6>

<ol>
	<li>All postings or messages express the views of the author, and not the owners of Africa Speaks.</li>
	<li>This is a strictly Moderated forum. The owners and staff of Africa Speaks reserve the right to remove, edit, move or close any thread for any reason. (Note: Staff includes Administrator, Moderators and Helpers)</li>
	<li>The use of all capital letters in member posts is prohibited. All such posts will be eliminated and members given a 1 point warning. Continued violations will result in the member account being suspended.</li>
	<li>The use of Avatars must comply with the following.
	<ul>
		<li>Avatars must not be offensive</li>
		<li>Avatars must not contain content which other members could find distressing</li>
		<li>Avatars must be suitable for persons aged 13+</li>
		<li>Africa Speaks staff may remove avatars if they are not deemed suitable</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>The use of usernames must comply with the following:
	<ul>
		<li>Usernames must not be offensive.</li>
		<li>Usernames must not contain content which other members could find distressing.</li>
		<li>Usernames must be suitable for persons aged 13+</li>
		<li>Africa Speaks staff may remove member accounts temporarily if the username they have chosen is not deemed suitable or is suggestive and not worthy of Christian values; this can be changed upon request.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ol>

<h6>Common courtesy</h6>

<ol>
	<li>Common courtesy and civil dialogue is expected from all participants. Common courtesy is a generally understood concept and too broad to fully define here. In short, if you have doubt on whether you should say something, DON'T!</li>
	<li>a &amp; b If someone disagrees with you:
	<ol>
		<li>Do not immediately jump to the conclusion that they are not truly saved just because they disagree.</li>
		<li>Do not attack the person. You may call a statement stupid, but NOT the person making that statement. Smart people can say dumb things.</li>
	</ol>
	</li>
	<li>Members starting threads on specific topics expect that the threads will stay essentially on topic. Any member, other than the person starting the thread, who takes a specific thread way off topic and derails the content of the thread will be given a friendly staff notice. A second derailment or continuation of the off topic direction by that member will result in a warning and all non topical posts in that thread will be eliminated. A third off topic hijacking by that member will result in a 1 week time out and all non topical posts in that thread will be eliminated. A fourth offense will result in a permanent ban and all posts by that member will be removed from CFS.</li>
</ol>

<h6>Unacceptable posts</h6>

<ol>
	<li>Disruptions to the friendly environment at Africa Speaks Community Forum by anyone will not be tolerated.</li>
	<li>When discussing any topic, please bear in mind the words of Paul in Romans 14:
	<blockquote>1 Accept other believers who are weak in faith, and don’t argue with them about what they think is right or wrong. 2 For instance, one person believes it’s all right to eat anything. But another believer with a sensitive conscience will eat only vegetables. 3 Those who feel free to eat anything must not look down on those who don’t. And those who don’t eat certain foods must not condemn those who do, for God has accepted them. 4 Who are you to condemn someone else’s servants? They are responsible to the Lord, so let Him judge whether they are right or wrong. And with the Lord’s help, they will do what is right and will receive His approval. 12 Yes, each of us will give a personal account to God. 13 So let’s stop condemning each other. Decide instead to live in such a way that you will not cause another believer to stumble and fall. 22 You may believe there’s nothing wrong with what you are doing, but keep it between yourself and God. Blessed are those who don’t feel guilty for doing something they have decided is right.</blockquote>

	<ol>
		<li>Members may not post any messages that are obscene, vulgar, sexually-oriented, hateful, demeaning, threatening, or insulting to any person or group; repeated in many posting areas (spam); or otherwise violates any laws. Such posts will be deleted and the Member warned or banned.</li>
		<li>Members may not post inflammatory remarks simply for the purpose of evoking reaction or starting fights with other Members, or promote a spirit of divisiveness in the community. Such posts will be deleted and the Member warned or banned. If you are responded to in an angry manner, do not respond in-kind. Alert staff to the situation by utilizing the report button.</li>
		<li>Certain topics have always sparked heated arguments and will be monitored by Forum Staff. Threads will be deleted and warnings and/or restrictions issued at the discretion of Forum Staff. The list of topics that can not be discussed at Africa Speaks are located in a pinned announcement at the top of the Doctrinal Discussion area. Members are warned not to mention these topics at any time.</li>
		<li>The Africa Speaks Community has a wide variety of members from around the World. This Forum does not allow the elevation of one Christian belief system over another. This is demeaning and belittling the beliefs of other Christians while promoting another system so as to create an atmosphere of superiority. Any such posts or threads will be removed and a reminder, warning or ban issued as necessary.</li>
		<li>Any discussions about any individual, teacher, preacher, pastor, minister, evangelist, media personality, organization, etc., will be closely monitored. Any claims that a named person or organization teaches or supports false doctrine MUST be well documented. Unsubstantiated claims, rumors or hearsay will not be allowed. Any such posts or threads will be removed and a reminder, warning or ban issued as necessary.</li>
		<li>Behavioral Post Moderation. If any member posts in a way that would initiate a staff warning under our Rules, that member may be placed on temporary Post Moderation - where posts from that member will be screened for content by a staff committee before they are published in the Forum. The CFS staff reserves the right to accept or reject any post from any member who is placed on Post Moderation - for conduct issues or if a new member has details in their application that may indicate that they may be here only to sell products or in any other way to violate Africa Speaks Community Forum Rules.</li>
	</ol>
	</li>
</ol>

<h6>False registration</h6>

<ol>
	<li>Registration with false information is grounds for immediate and permanent banning. Multiple registrations by the same General Member using different usernames is not allowed and all usernames and IP addresses for the General Member will be banned. Registration with many persons using one username is immediate grounds for banning. If two different General Members are sharing a wireless router or Internet connection that may show the same IP address, we would appreciate a PM notification to any staff member about that so the situation can be logged.</li>
	<li>Any Member under the age of 16 (sixteen) years of age must supply contact information for a parent or guardian when requested, so the Africa Speaks Administration can verify permission has been granted or a parent or guardian is aware of them participating here at CFS. Falsifying birth dates to be excluded from this requirement will be immediate grounds for permanently banning the Member.</li>
</ol>

<h6>Moderator/Helper requests</h6>

<ol>
	<li>All Members are required to immediately comply with any Moderator or Helper request.</li>
	<li>If you believe that a Moderator/Helper directive is incorrect you should not discuss it in the open forum. Instead send a private message to the Administrator or a different staff member for discussion. Threads or posts in the open forum discussing Community members who have been disciplined in any way, criticizing Forum Rules or criticizing Africa Speaks staff members will not be permitted. Such threads or posts will be deleted and warnings and/or restrictions will be issued at the discretion of the Forum staff.</li>
</ol>

<h6>Personal Details - Postal address or email address</h6>

<ol>
	<li>Do not give your personal details, such as postal address or email address, to anyone except the Administrator or a Moderator authorized to ask for a mailing address as directed by the Administrator.</li>
	<li>A General Member may see Member phone number, street mailing address, email or instant message information if those settings are enabled. If someone annoys you through email or PM, notify the Moderators or the Administrator immediately and we will notify may ban the offending user about this behavior. Do not reply to unknown emails.</li>
	<li>&nbsp;</li>
</ol>

<h6>Links to other Websites</h6>

<ol>
	<li>Our Forum may contain links to other Web sites placed here by members in technical violation of Rule 2 below. Please note that when you click on one of these links, you are entering another Website for which The Africa Speaks has no responsibility or liability. We encourage you to read the privacy statements on all such sites as their policies may be different from ours. The Moderators/Administrator at Africa Speaks cannot possibly monitor all the numerous daily postings of off-site linking. Anyone visiting a site linked on the Forum by MEMBERS does so at your own risk. Be especially wary of those sites which sell products, services or ask for donations. Again, the Staff at Africa Speaks takes no responsibility what-so-ever in the claims or statements made in ANY linked sites. Please report postings within the Forum which contain objectionable material as well as objectionable material contained in offsite links posted by CFS members. Use the "Report Post" button below the poster's name to tell us about your concerns.</li>
	<li>If any member wishes to post at CFS with any request for funding, for offering products for sale or to place a link in this forum to any site that requests financial donations, sells any type of products or links to self promotion sites, they must first obtain permission from our Administrative staff via PM. Please include sales details, funding details or the off-site link URL in your PM request as well as a list of products or services that are offered from you or through that site. This permission will only be granted in exceptional circumstances, if at all.</li>
	<li>If permission is granted to include an off site link on a post to a web page that sells products or services, they must also post the following warning notice together with the link.</li>
</ol>

<div class="alert alert-danger">
<p>MODERATOR'S CAUTION:</p>

<p>The link in this post goes to a website which sells goods or services or solicits donations or goes to a self promotion site. Members are advised to be wary of ANY such donation requests or sales and to research the group or individual making the request or sales and to PRAY before sending ANY donation or before purchasing any goods or services.</p>

<p>The following Disclaimer may also be used by the Africa Speaks Staff when unusual donation or funding circumstances arise.</p>

<p class="font-italic">If any member feels moved to help/donate to any ministry or other worthy cause, they are strongly advised to do their own independent research. No links to any funding will be posted in the open forums. Members are free to conduct their own online searches, or to request further information via the pm system from anyone they are considering trying to help. CFS will not endorse or be held responsible for any such activity.</p>
</div>

<h6>Copyright Issues</h6>

<ol>
	<li>Any time that you "quote" someone else's works or provide a video, you must be certain that there is Copyright © Waiver or reposting authorization posted in the original source indicating that you can quote all or part of that original author's work or use a video. Text of copyright waivers, author permissions or public domain statements from source pages must accompany any copied materials that members post at CFS at the bottom of the copied post. If you just copy and paste text randomly or post a copyrighted video without regard for the Copyrighting © of that text or video, you bring liability issues into the equation and we at CFS will take appropriate action to keep infringement issues out of this forum.</li>
